# risb
Rotationally invariant slave-bosons.

### Todo

- Add kweights tests, DIIS tests, multiple cluster tests, complex SOC tests, 
all helpers functions (make random inputs and store, because current tests
have too much structure)
- Fix sensitive to initial R, Lambda guess, make more robust
- Get static type hints working for mypy
- Add verbose output to LatticeSolver
- Add verbose output to DIIS
- Maybe? Refactor DIIS and NewtonSolver
- Explanation for why the root finders kind of suck.

### In Progress

- Setup github actions
- Helper functions for calculating free/total energy
- More tutorial examples
- Finish TBmodels in tight-binding how-to
- Sort out intersphinx linking in docs
